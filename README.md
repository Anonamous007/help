Question: Good character 

Find the character that appears most often across all possible substrings of a given string. 


Good character Find the character that appears most often across all possible substrings of a given string. If there are several characters with the same highest frequency. print the one that is smallest in lexicographical order. Function description Complete the solve() function. The function takes 2 parameters and returns a character denoting the answer to the question: - N. Represents the length of the string - S. Represents the string Input format for custom testing Note Use this input format if you are testing against custom input or writing code in a language where we don't provide boilerplate code. - The first line contains T. which represents the number of test cases - For each test case. - The first line contains an integer N

Question: Given a rectangle with dimensions N'M and an integer K. You divide this rectangle into smaller sub-rectangles such that the given conditions are satisfied: • Sub-rectangles must be parallel to the axis of the larger rectangle with dimensions N'M • Every sub-rectangle has at least one edge on the larger rectangle edge. Informally, there is no sub-rectangle
Given a rectangle with dimensions N'M and an integer K. You divide this rectangle into smaller sub-rectangles such that the given conditions are satisfied:

• Sub-rectangles must be parallel to the axis of the larger rectangle with dimensions N'M

• Every sub-rectangle has at least one edge on the larger rectangle edge. Informally, there is no sub-rectangle that is surrounded by other sub-rectangles.

For a sub-rectangle with area S, the cost of this sub-rectangle is (S-K)2

Calculate the minimum total cost to divide the larger rectangle into smaller sub-rectangles.

Note: All sub-rectangles must have an integral length of dimensions.

Function description
Complete the solve function. This function takes the following 3 parameters and returns the required answer:

⚫N: Represents the value of N

• M. Represents the value of M

• K: Represents the value of K
